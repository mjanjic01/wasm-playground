## wasm playground
Simple examples of compiling C code to WebAssembly for the web.

Requires [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)

```
# Makefile builds ball example by default.

make native # native build
make wasm   # WebAssembly build
make clean  # Clean build files
```

Cube example - from [https://github.com/callahad/spinning-cube](https://github.com/callahad/spinning-cube)
